Getting Started with React
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Introduction
This README will guide you through the setup process for a new React project and provide basic information on how to start developing with React.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js and npm (or yarn)
A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
Installation
Create a New React App:

You can create a new React app using Create React App, an officially supported tool for bootstrapping React projects:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-react-app
Replace my-react-app with the desired name of your project.

Navigate to the Project Directory:

Once the project is created, navigate into the newly created directory:

bash
Copy code
cd my-react-app
Running the Development Server
After setting up your project, you can start the development server and view your React app in a web browser:

bash
Copy code
npm start
or if you are using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn start
This command starts the development server and opens your default web browser to display your React application. The development server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to your code, allowing you to see your updates in real-time.

Project Structure
The default project structure created by Create React App looks like this:

java
Copy code
my-react-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
public/: Contains static assets like HTML files and favicon.
src/: Contains the source code of your React application.
src/index.js: The entry point of your application.
src/App.js: The main component of your application.
You can start editing the src/App.js file to make changes to your React application.
